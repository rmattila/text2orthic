wk
tw, dw
need smoothing: io, eo
ae, ea, ia
correct curve of ae/ea, ai/ia, ya
rt, tr
lt

Join fixing, roughly by severity of the problem:

* ex (lex)
* kn (know)
* ee (bee)
* ew, iw, eew, iew (hooked w in new, view)
* ech, ich (sketch, rich)
* ec, ic (-fice)

Trickier cases to look at later:

* final -th$
* -ing vs ing (both in one word: "kinging") requires either a dictionary or semantic awareness

"Slurring mode" for smoother writing more like you'd find in practice:

* ["other prefixes and slurs"](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement#other-prefixes-and-slurs)
* ["terminations"](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement#terminations)
* gd
* mk
* final ks$
* final fs$
* mn at 90 px wide
* td/dt at 90 px wide

Note: Small letters are roughly 30px wide, large 60px.
