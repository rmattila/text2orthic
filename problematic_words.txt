Join fixing, roughly by severity of the problem:

* ex (lex)
* kn (know)
* ee (bee)
* ew, iw, eew, iew (hooked w in new, view)
* ech, ich (sketch, rich)
* ec, ic (-fice)

Trickier cases to look at later:

* ea: not getting smoothed due to some join fixup glyphs: se, be, ere. Tests: seat should use ea_over_angled, beast likewise, cereal should use regular (under) ea.
* final -th$
* -ing vs ing (both in one word: "kinging") requires either a dictionary or semantic awareness

"Ordinary mode" for smoother writing more like you'd find in practice:

* [manual "abbrevations" including common endings](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/manual#abbreviations)
* [supplement "other prefixes and slurs"](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement#other-prefixes-and-slurs) eg dv, mb
* [supplement "terminations"](https://orthic.shorthand.fun/supplement#terminations)
* gd
* mk
* final ks$
* final fs$
* mn at 90 px wide
* td/dt at 90 px wide

Note: Small letters are roughly 30px wide, large 60px.

Originally thought io and eo needed smoothing, but much of the time, outside -tion and maybe -[ei]ous, they fall across syllable breaks, so they're fine as-is.
