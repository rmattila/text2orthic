standalone L and L.: needs intro stroke
ay: not using digraph
ng: needs digraph (though full ing is fine)
* w: needs medial, final handling
sw, ws: not using digraph
wl: wrong digraph
oa, ao: wrong
nl, pl: L on wrong side
be, bi: need digraph to avoid overlap

need smoothing: io, eo, au
ae, ea, ia
* hard: correct curve of ae/ea, ai/ia, ay/ya
gills
rich
efficient
bin
ability
complex
rt, tr

Trickier cases to look at later:

* should handle final -th
* "ee" doesn't combine well with some letters like in "bee"
