nl, pl: L on wrong side
be, bi: need digraph to avoid overlap
need improvement, but not flat wrong: rl, ec, ic, wn, gd, mk, tw, dw, wl; will need wn digraph once have med/fin w support

ae, ea, ia
* correct curve of ae/ea, ai/ia, ya
gills
rich
efficient
bin
ability
complex
rt, tr
ew, iw need their own custom digraph to handle the "hooking"

Trickier cases to look at later:

* should handle final -th
* "ee" doesn't combine well with some letters like in "bee"
* -ing vs ing (both in one word: "kinging") requires either a dictionary or semantic awareness
